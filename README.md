This program will run in whatever folder you install it in, as long as shodan is installed 
(make sure to replace the API key with the appropriate key - I'm not putting the API key on a public platform)

To use: simply enter any flags you want to use, just like you would with the GUI version
Type 'search' once you have added all the flags/options/criteria that you want

All of the data that you get after your search will be saved to a .json file
I haven't figured out how to add newlines in .json yet, so that's something I'll add in the future

Have fun!

Also I was too tired to add comments for everything - comments will come later
